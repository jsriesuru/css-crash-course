	     <h1>Hello world</h1>
	      <p>Almost every episode starts with a desperate scream of how to eat Jerry! Tom uses every strategy, tools and weapons to kill Jerry, and Jerry keeps finding relevant means of way to escape. He comes out unhurt even if Tom successfully swallows him. Sometimes, the fight takes an ugly and destructive shape compelling Jerry to uses explosives to blow up Tom’s face or portion of body but he never intends to kill him. After the temporary journey of pain, sufferings, and tortures, Jerry always wins and proves size does not always matter. Both Tom and Jerry have their own challenges, adversaries but they were born to never give up; they bounce back with victories.</p></div>
